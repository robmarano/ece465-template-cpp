ECE 465 Source Code Template for C++

This repo provides a client program that connects via a socket listening by a server program. The code is C++ built with Boost. Read [HOWTO-BOOST-UBUNTU.md](./HOWTO-BOOST-UBUNTU.md) to install and use Boost.

This has been tested on Ubuntu (WSL) and Mac OS. Be careful to configure Base.mk and the run-client.sh and run-server.sh shell files that run the programs.
